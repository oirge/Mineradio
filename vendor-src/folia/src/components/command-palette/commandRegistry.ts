 * Puts the library suites' chrome commands (B2, built by commands/suiteChromeCommands from the manifests'
 * `chromeActions`) into the list, replacing whatever an earlier call put there — so a second call (HMR,
 * tests) does not duplicate them.
 *
 * They cannot be part of the static list: the manifests live behind the library registry, which this
 * module must not import. The app installs them once at startup (library/app/installLibrarySuiteChromeCommands),
 * before anything renders. The static list's invariants are re-checked over the combined list here, the
 * same way commands/index.ts checks them at module load: a duplicate id or an execute shortcut that is
 * not prefix-free against everything it can be offered with throws, and the list is left as it was.
 *
 * Mutated in place rather than reassigned, because every consumer imported the array itself (mod
 * commands are mirrored in the same way, see mods/folium/commandPaletteSync.ts).

// module-level cache keyed on context identity would serve those a stale answer, which is the one
// bug this whole gating design exists to avoid.
//
// The cost this used to carry — two full passes per rank cycle — is gone anyway: the palette hook

// React memo. Identity stabilization lives there too, next to the `isOpen` key that invalidates it.
