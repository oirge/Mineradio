//
// The three grids each used to carry a window keydown listener that turned any printable character
// into "open my search panel", plus their own `<input>`. That is three copies of one idea, and it
// is also why the palette could not open on home: a bare key meant two different things at once.
// Now the grid says "I read typing, here is where the text goes and where the box belongs", and the
// palette does the rest.
//
// The two halves come from different places: the query port is whatever owns the text (component
// state, or a Library Core browse session), the anchor is always the renderer's own element. They
// are joined only here, at registration, so core code never has to know about the DOM.
